Despite this, the economics of the region had become too reliant on the rejected fission core (aptly known as steam cores) design, and thus development of the weapons fueled on steam cores continued.\nThese steam cores give all of our equipment a powerful kickback in the strength they give out, yet also come with certain rare failure incidents."
