  utah_religion_lon_desc:0 "When the world was broken down by apocalyptic fire, when the great clouds of ash had settled, and those few survivors that remained dared not leave their shelters, the world was finally at peace.

 hgh_nicea:0 "Nicea, Bastion of Yore and Now"
 hgh_nicea_desc:0 "Not every ruin fell to time. Nicea stands still—stone upon stone, sermon upon sermon. It is the seat of the Council, where scripture is weighed, and the old river laws still hold sway. What was once a shelter is now a citadel of thought and grace."
 
 hgh_schism:0 "The Southern Schism"
 hgh_schism_desc:0 "Once, the Pentecostal Kingdom stretched wide, united under scripture and fervor. But peace and blood do not share the same gospel. When the Reformers fled their burning homes and the Anointed vowed vengeance, the river to our south split with sorrow. We watched, prayed, and refused them entry. Now, both sides grow stronger, and the Schism flows north."
