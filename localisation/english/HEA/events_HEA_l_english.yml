  nf_event_hea.1.d:0 "The Heaven's Gate has always heeded the word of God, being directed by various prophets and leaders throughout its long history. Preachers have come and gone, speaking the good word to desperate people. Many verses have always held great weight with us, but none more so than the following."

  nf_event_hea.2.d:0 "Those who make the journey to Heaven's Gate often travel great distances, knowing in their heart of hearts that somewhere past the horizon is the last true bastion of godliness in this forlorn and forgotten wasteland. Yet when they arrive, there is always the question. Has their pilgrimage ended, or are they now duty bound to seek out and lead the faithful here? What does the bible say of such things?"

  nf_event_hea.3.d:0 "Those who do not hear the word of God may still hear of the Gate, and may still travel here. The concerns that we face in the ancient question of how to deal with those pagan visitors are eternal. There are those who feel we should protect and house these lost souls, and those who believe that we should reject them."

  nf_event_hea.4.t:0 "Innocence Lost"
  nf_event_hea.4.d:0 "Innocence is little more than a farming community on the very edge of what we know, often visited by travelling pagans and tribals coming down from the northern wildlands. These people often arrive to trade and exchange goods, and in turn we teach them of God, gifting them alms in return for their time (a precious commodity in the wasteland). Yet often, there are groups more resistance to this than others, those elders and warlike souls who feel that our lessons are an affront to their own misguided beliefs. Tensions were running high...and we were fools for not realizing just what could occur...\n\n They struck in the dead of night, when most souls were asleep, the town guard were quickly overtaken, the village burned, nearly a thousand souls lost in the blink of an eye, our stores ransacked, cattle killed or stolen, and the once vibrant community of farmers and dabbling traders was a husk of its former life. Two men were reborn amidst the ashes. \n A survivor, a member of the militia who was thought dead. He was brought back from the brink of death when the forces of the Nucleus arrived, too little too late, casting aside his old name, the simple guard picked up his rifle, and set out in hunt of the pagans who did this, to atone for his failures \nThe other? His name was Father Michael, a warrior who had protected the flock for decades, a shephard true, yet on that day he saw the wasteland for what it was. A world twisted by hellfire, where evil roamed free, content to take and take until there was nothing left. Something would have to be done..."

He extends his hand, offering New Canaan the decision of joining with the Holy Alliance he has begun to create, he does not mean to conquer the world like Ceaser, but instead wishes to protect the Flock. He does not make this offer under threat of might of arms, but there is a promise of sanctuary if we do accept his offer. Looking at the man, his stance, and the few 'knights' he has, there is no doubt in many of the faithful's mind, if New Canaan were to join Heaven's Gate, we would never have to fear again."

Already he could see their curse attempting to help them, sporadically shooting out, but the boilers were blessed by the lord, they would not escape judgment. \n\n When all the witches were purified, he watched with satisfaction as some of the puppets were freed with fervor in their eyes, they would fight for the Lord, he saw it. \n\n The city burned with a spectacular glow as his army left it, When asked what it would be renamed to?

You've already killed thousands, how many more must follow for innocents whose tombs are already drenched in blood?" Another elder asked.

 ###### Shattered Cities of the 10th Crusade

 nf_event_hea.600.t:0 "The Burning of High Chapel"
 nf_event_hea.600.desc:0 "High Chapel did not fall in silence. It screamed. \n\n When the Gates opened, when the horns blared across the ridge, the Fleet Foot were already moving — striking from the treeline, flanking, disappearing into the brush like ghosts. They were righteous in their way, zealous in their own scripture. They believed Heaven’s Gate to be heretics wrapped in steel. \n\n But belief does not stop bullets. \n\n The Guard met them head-on. Line for line. Flame for flame. It wasn’t strategy that broke the Fleet Foot — it was attrition. Every ridge, every gulley became a grave. Their famed mobility shattered when the steam tanks hissed over the hills and scorched the roots beneath their boots. \n\n By the seventh day, the defenders were holed up in the Chapel itself — that ancient spire of stone and wood, its cross blackened by soot, its bells cracked by shelling. Saint Michael stood outside its doors, speaking not to parley but to pronounce judgment. \n\n “The Lord is not in these walls,” he said. “He waits elsewhere.” \n\n And the Chapel burned. \n\n The sky glowed crimson as the spire fell. No prisoners were taken. No relics saved. The scorched icon of High Chapel’s false god was ground beneath boot and tread, and the ashes were spread to the winds."

 nf_event_hea.601.desc:0 "Smoke still curled from the Chapel’s broken cross. \n\n The flames had not yet died. The stone walls crackled with lingering heat. And amidst the ruin, as steam tanks rumbled down from the heights and the Knights of the Gate marched through bloodied pews, a child appeared — walking from the edge of the treeline, barefoot and silent. Her name was Amelia. \n\n She was too young to know war. Too small to carry the weight of grief. But she bore it anyway. Her father had died in the first charge — not a saint, not a hero. Just a man who believed. A farmer who marched because he was asked to, and died before the horns even finished sounding. \n\n He had left her with nothing — except a scrap of cloth, and a red handprint in paint. “For when I come home,” he’d told her. \n\n Now she walked through the ash, holding that same cloth — stitched with a sun, ringed with stick figures, edged with a child’s crooked words: “There is always tomorrow. God willing.” \n\n The knights who remained said nothing. Some turned away. Others knelt. \n\nAmelia kept walking. The banner hung loose in her arms. Her hands trembled, but her feet did not falter. She was alone. \n\n Before the charge, a small escort had been assigned to protect her — a handful of the guard who had sworn to see her to the foot of the Chapel, where her father had last been seen. None survived the ascent. Their bodies lay broken across the hills. Their armor scorched, their blades shattered. But they had stood between her and death — and now, they would remain with her in another way. \n\n One by one, Amelia pressed their hands into the cloth: soot, blood, oil, flesh. No names. No rank. Just memory. Just love repaid. She said nothing. Only breathed. And then Saint Michael saw her. \n\n He stood at the top of the chapel stairs, flame still curling around his pauldrons. For a long moment, he did not speak. Then he stepped down and placed his own hand beside the others. He looked to the banner — ten marks and one of innocence — and said: “Let it be raised when the battle is won. Let it bear the mark of the faithful, and the weight of their sacrifice. And let it fly not as a banner of victory — but as a promise to those who remain, that the sun will rise again.” \n\n And so it began. \n\n Now, in every campaign, a child is chosen. They carry a blank banner — guarding it like scripture. They walk where the dead lie thickest, and press the hands of the fallen into its cloth. At battle’s end, they raise it. \n\nNot as a boast. \nAs a vow. \nThe first handprint was his."

They prayed, but not to steam. They gathered in quiet churches to debate scripture instead of wielding it. They believed that understanding was the path to salvation. \n\n Heaven’s Gate gave them a chance to repent. \n\n Some did. Others fled into the redrock canyons, clutching their books and shattered creeds. A few stood beside their altars, hands raised in peace, and were cut down regardless — not in hatred, but in certainty. \n\n Saint Michael did not walk the streets. He waited on a ridge outside the city, watching smoke rise from rooftops that had never known war. He did not cheer when the gates fell. He did not pray when the blood dried. \n\n Instead, he whispered, “They knew better. And still, they chose rebellion.” \n\n It was a smaller boy this time. Barefoot, wind-chapped, his robes oversized and ragged. His name was Elijah, and he had carried the banner with both pride and fear — unsure what it truly meant until he stood in the ashes of the Reformers’ sanctuary. \n\n There, among ruined pews and scorched texts, he laid the cloth flat and pressed a soot-blackened hand into the center. \n\n One hand. One Knight. The first to die breaching the temple doors. \n\n The flag was raised from the broken steeple, its single mark standing solemn against the rising sun. \n\n And the soldiers wept. Not for the victory. \n\n But because the boy who bore Elijah’s Banner asked them, “Why did we have to kill the people who knew His name?” \n\n No one answered. They simply knelt."

They were not raiders nor tribals. They were zealots — molded by scripture older than Heaven’s Gate itself, convinced that they alone held the keys to salvation. \n\n When Saint Michael approached their walls, he did not threaten. He offered parley. Redemption. \n\n The Lord’s Anointed responded with fire. \n\n The flames they lit along the orchard walls were not of war — they were of sacrifice. Children taken from their mothers, witches burned in rows, heretics lashed until bone was bared. All of it made visible to the Knights of the Gate as a warning. “We keep Eden clean,” they cried from atop crimson-stained ramparts. “You bring the rot of mercy.” \n\n And so the cleansing began. \n\n Heaven’s Gate did not march — it descended. Choirs of thunder from mountaintop artillery. Steam-driven paladins breaching the Temple Gates. The prayers of the Gate turned into roars, each hymn a commandment of steel. \n\n The Lord’s Anointed did not yield. They died on their knees, not in surrender — but in ecstasy. \n\n In the heart of Eden, beneath a statue of the Prophet Ezekiel carved in bone, Saint Michael found the last High Shepherd — eyes gone blind, tongue split in ritual. He spoke not a word. Only pointed to the crucified corpses of the innocent and smiled as if to say: "We did what He asked." \n\n Michael raised his sword. And Eden wept. \n\n When the smoke cleared, only the central garden remained. Its trees were dead. Its water, still. \n\n A child named Ezekia stepped forward. Born of the faithful but taken during a border raid, she had been raised in Eden’s shadow — branded, silenced, forgotten. Now, she held a new banner in her hands. \n\n It bore the handprints of those who fell reclaiming her past. And with trembling fingers, she pressed it into the blood-soaked soil of the Prophet’s Plaza. \n\n She did not raise it to the wind. \n\n She planted it — like a seed. \n\n A cradle of tomorrow, buried in the ashes of man’s most righteous delusion. \n\nAs the Knights gathered in silence, Saint Michael spoke: “Let no shepherd rise here again.

The Lord’s Anointed looked to the heavens, where purity was fire and grace was earned in pain. \n\n For over a decade, they called each other heretic. \n\n Now, both are silent. \n\n In Murtaugh, the last Reformer scribe—once a man of great sermons—sat upon the pulpit and wept into ash. He did not flee. He welcomed the Gate. “So that God may speak plainly again,” he said before steam devoured the temple. \n\n In Eden, the High Shepherd’s body hung like fruit from a burned-out fig tree, his bones hollowed by fire, his scripture charred to dust. \n\n No scrolls were saved. No doctrine preserved. No arguments endured. \n\n Saint Michael did not speak of peace. He simply walked the road between both cities, his footsteps smothering the last cries of an old, holy war. \n\ Two cities. Two dogmas. \n  One judgment. \n One silence. \n \nIn the aftermath, his words echoed not from a pulpit, but across the wastes: “The Lord does not recognize divided tongues.

The guards simply laid down their arms, their clean uniforms smeared in ash, their perfect records unspoken. \n\n Saint Michael walked the sterilized halls of the Vault, past untouched terminals and empty offices, and said nothing. He found no joy in the conquest. The city had no soul to bleed. \n\n In the central clinic — once a temple to old-world medicine — the children of the Gate gathered. There, beside cooling machines and shattered monitors, a boy named Samuel unrolled his blank banner. \n\n His voice trembled, but his hands did not. \n\n The fallen were few — but every mark pressed into the fabric was deliberate, smudged with sterilized soot and prayers whispered low. Some Knights refused to let their names be remembered.

The only music was the echo of boots and the low chant of steam-etched hymns as the knights advanced, their silhouettes lit by the fires they did not start — but refused to stop. \n\n Saint Michael walked through the ruins of the Capitol, past the bones of statues and the shattered emblems of the New California Republic. He said no words. His sword was still. His voice came only when asked what this place had been. \n\n“A temple,” he answered, “to men who thought themselves gods.” \n\n At the city’s broken heart, the last stand had already ended. The defenders did not scream. They simply held the line until the line disappeared. They died in silence — and so the Gate answered with silence of its own. \n\n And then came the girl. \n\n Leah, an orphan of the wastes, found among the rubble, barefoot and quiet. She carried with her a banner — blank until this day, folded in a scrap of linen once wrapped around her brother’s body. No one told her what to do. She simply walked, and the soldiers cleared the path. \n\n She climbed the ruined steps of the Capitol, knelt beside a fallen knight, and pressed his hand into the cloth. Then another. Then another. Ash and oil and blood. \n\n The banner did not flutter. \n\n It hung heavy, soaked in sorrow and something more — the memory of the Republic, and the promise that the world would not end with it. \n\n When Leah’s Flag was raised above the charred dome, it did not declare victory.

The old code remained — steel-bound and sacred — but their strength had waned. No reinforcements would come. The world had moved on. And still, they stood. \n\n Saint Michael offered no ultimatum.

The defenders fought like ghosts refusing exorcism — disciplined, silent, and absolute. \n\n But the Gate was endless. When they reached the final sanctum, they found it sealed. Quiet. Waiting. \n\n A countdown was already underway. \n\n The last act of the Brotherhood was not surrender — but sacrifice. Deep within the databanks, beneath layers of code, a final contingency had been prepared for this day. Not to preserve — but to deny. \n\n The mountain shook. Flame bled from its veins. Steel bent, stone split, and Lost Hills — the first chapter of the Brotherhood — tore itself from history in a cloud of fire and ash. \n\n When the smoke cleared, there was nothing left to conquer. Only slag and silence. \n\nSaint Michael stood at the edge of the crater and spoke, not in triumph, but reverence: “Even in death, they were faithful to the world that birthed them.” \n\n No banner was raised.

The kind his younger self would have scorned. \n\n At the heart of the city, the elders of New Canaan awaited him, heads bowed. They did not beg, nor resist. They offered tea. They asked nothing. \n\n Michael looked to their faces and found no cowardice — only weariness. A tired wisdom that comes from surviving too long, believing too much, and losing too often. \n\nHe spoke softly. “I bring not conquest, but correction.” \n\n And the elders, in voices dry as parchment, replied: “Then let the scripture be rewritten.” \n\n That day, a banner was raised — not by a child of New Canaan, but by one of Heaven’s Gate.

The Strip, ever proud in its decadence, became a silhouette against a fire-lit sky. Its gamblers had long fled or been conscripted into militia. Its kings and warlords had fractured. All that remained was Hoover Dam — its veins still pulsing with power, its heart still beating for a people that no longer held it. \n\n The battle was not bloodless. \n\n In the glass and steel canyons of the Strip, the last resistance did not come from men — but from machines. Securitrons, bound by old code and flickering directives, fired from hotel balconies and buried turrets. They spoke in static-tinged voices of protection, safety, Mr. House, war protocols — none of it mattered anymore. \n\n The Knights advanced slow, methodical — a sermon of death, page by page. Plasma scorched scripture. Lasers carved through hymns. But still they advanced, until the Strip fell silent once more. \n\n Saint Michael walked the Strip in the aftermath, stepping over poker chips and shattered marquees. He beheld Lucky 38 — still standing, still glowing, but no longer defiant. It blinked like a dying eye. \n\n Atop the ruined Welcome Arch, a child stood. Her name was Junia. She had not fled, not hidden. She had watched. For days, she had carried her flag, blank and folded, in the folds of her coat. \n\n When the sun finally rose on New Vegas — weak, red, and trembling — Junia climbed atop the crumbling tower.

None were spared. \n\n Saint Michael stood in the center of the old forum, where once Caesar had addressed his warlords. He said nothing. He only raised his hand — and from the procession behind him came a small boy, no older than nine, barefoot and carrying a folded banner of white linen. \n\nHis name was Cassian. His sister had died in the breeding pits of the Bull. His village was left in cinders. Now he stood here, at the place where it all began. \n\n The Knights of the Gate laid out the banner. The soot-stained handprints were pressed into it — one by one, names unspoken, faith unshaken. When the last print was placed, Cassian raised the flag over the temple ruins. The sky was ash.

Grease-streaked, bare-footed, too small to lift a gun — but clutching the banner he had been chosen to carry.

Never bent the knee. \n\n It would not do so now. \n\n When the armies of Heaven’s Gate came — steel-clad, scripture-bound, wrapped in steam and fury — the Monster of the East did not wait in his tower. \n\n He led. \n\n Lanius charged from the gates with his legion behind him, blades high, voices hoarse from a lifetime of war cries. He led not as a commander, but as the point of a spear driven by centuries of pain and conquest. Veterans painted their faces with ashes. Slaves turned soldiers screamed until their throats tore. Dust howled around them like wolves set loose from time. \n\n It was not a battle. \n\n It was a sermon. \n\n “We are the flame that purges sin,” Michael intoned. \n\n “We are the blade that breaks the weak,” Lanius roared. \n\n The knights met them at the canyon’s mouth, not with hesitation, but with hymns. They raised shields etched with verses, wielded spears glowing with the hiss of sanctified steam. Behind them, Saint Michael stood unmoving, his blade buried in the dust, his hands clasped in prayer. \n\n The Legion broke upon the Gate like a wave of iron and hate. Every strike of their blades was a line from scripture, every death a punctuation carved in flesh. For hours, the sands turned red. For hours, the air screamed. \n\n Then silence. \n\n From the carnage, only two remained — the Monster, battered but unbroken, and the Saint, steam rising from his pauldrons. \n\n They faced each other in the temple courtyard, beneath banners torn and half-burned. The air was thick with incense and gunpowder, the dead stacked like pews. \n\n Lanius lifted his blade. He spoke only once more: \n\n “You are not my god.” \n“No," Michael said. "I buried him beneath my blade.” \n\n Saint Michael raised his sword. And then the sermon began anew — not with words, but with war. \n\nSteel against steel. Blood upon blood. A thunderclap of belief and fury. \n\n When it was over, neither man stood. \nThe Gate carried away their Saint. \nThe Legion did not carry Lanius. \n\n They buried him where he fell, in the center of Rubrum — a shrine of ruin, a grave of pride. \n\nA child — Julia, born of smoke and war, once dragged by chains through Rubrum’s halls — carried the blank banner to the pyre. She pressed the handprints of the fallen into it, her own among them. Her tears made no sound. \n\nWhen Julia’s Flag was raised above the shattered gates, the smoke parted just enough for the red sun to shine through. \n\nIt did not rise. \n\nIt simply watched."

 nf_event_hea.620.d:0 "Dallas had been many things. \n A city of vaults and cowboys. \n A capital of power-armored pride. \nThe heart of the Texas Brotherhood — and the last star that stood between Heaven’s Gate and the southern wastes. \n\n The Paladins there did not fear Heaven’s Gate. \nThey respected it. \n\nFor weeks, the banners of Christ and circuitry watched each other across the broken highways. Radio silence was held like a breath. The war drums were not loud — but the prayers were. \n\n Then came the lightning. \n\n Saint Michael unleashed his storm beneath a sky made crimson by the dust winds. The Gate’s forces struck in staggered hymns — drills, sieges, psalms written in gunfire. They cracked the walls of Fort Worth with boiling steam and sanctified shellfire. \n\nThe Texas Brotherhood answered. Not with mercy — but with memory. \n\n At their head stood Elder Edward J. Rusk — the last cowboy of the old world, his ten-gallon hat shadowing eyes that had stared down death a hundred times over. They said his voice could silence a mess hall, that he never once flinched when a mutant roared, and that when he spoke, even malfunctioning servitors stopped to listen. A cigar always burned in the corner of his mouth — not out of habit, but as ritual, a final ember of the world that was. \n\nWhen word reached him of the coming storm, Rusk didn’t retreat. He opened the vaults. \n\nThey deployed their greatest relics. Airborne knights rode vertibird wings carved with scripture. Artillery older than the bombs roared across the wastes, their shells painted with the Brotherhood’s sigil. Crusader bots chanted psalms in binary. Paladins wore armor not just polished — but anointed. And over it all, Rusk walked with a break-action shotgun in hand — the kind that fired lightning, not lead. \n\nThe Texas Brotherhood fought not as remnants, but as heirs to a forgotten empire — each blow a declaration, each step a vow. \n\n And slowly, inevitably… they were broken. \n\n As the Gate closed on Dallas, Rusk gave his last order. It was not to hold the line. It was to buy time. \n\n He led the final defense with a smile and a hymn on his lips — a gospel of grit, glory, and defiance. No grand speeches. No last words. Just one final look at the sky, and a muttered line: \n\n "Texas was built on last stands.” \n\n When the Gate finally reached Dallas proper, the city lit up not with defense — but with fire. Dozens of Paladins sealed themselves within the cathedral-fortress at the city’s heart, the last chapter’s soul, and opened its vaults one final time — not to flee, but to give their people a chance. \n\n Civilians were guided underground. Choirs of scribes burned data they could not let be taken. And the Paladins fought with holy rage, shouting verses from both Codex and Gospel. \n\nThey did not surrender. \n\nWhen the last shot rang out, and the Gate breached the fortress gates, they found the defenders kneeling — not in submission, but in silence. Martyrs in steel. The flag of Texas scorched behind them. And Elder Rusk, hat laid across his chest, smoke curling from his spent weapon, smiling still. \n\n Because he knew the Gate would never find the bodies that mattered. \n\n They were already halfway to freedom. \nNo child raised a banner that day. \n\n But weeks later, south of the Red River, from a shattered chapel where the last refugees had fled, a girl named Isadora unfurled a piece of white cloth upon the ruins. \n\nShe pressed her mother’s handprint into it — a Scribe who never returned — and whispered: “She kept the light. So I would know what it was.” \n\nIsadora’s Flag is not known in Heaven’s Gate. \nBut across the Texas plains, in bunkers and barns, whispers still pass beneath the breath:"

 nf_event_hea.621.desc:0 "The Republic of the Rio Grande had always walked a tightrope — between memory and survival, between American steel and Mexican soul. It remembered the stars and stripes, even when they were half-burned and hanging from broken flagpoles. It remembered freedom, even when the ballots came from trembling hands and guarded booths. \n\n President Dante Guerra did not kneel. When Heaven's Gate crossed the Rio Bravo, there were no ultimatums, no final offers. Only a broadcast. He stood before the cameras in his worn uniform, flanked by the faded banners of the old Republic, and said: \n\n "We have been ruled before — by empires, by tyrants, by those who saw only a land to break and a people to bend. But not today. Not by steam. Not by sword." \n\nThe broadcast was cut mid-sentence by the scream of descending shells. \n\nThe Texan Arms Association fled first — taking their wealth, their engineers, and what few weapons they could carry. The militias, left behind, fought in alleys and canals, beneath rusting oil derricks and the painted murals of lost saints. \n\n Guerra’s Guards made their last stand at the presidential palace — not to protect power, but to give time for the last civilian convoys to escape through the undercity. \n\nThey did not escape. \n\n When the Gate took Rio Republic City, they found the palace hollowed by fire, its defenders lying beside the bodies of their countrymen. No banners flew above its ruins. \n\nExcept one. \n\nA child had found the flag — not of the Gate, but of the Republic. Burnt, stitched back together with trembling hands, soaked in smoke. She raised it from a scorched balcony, her face bloodied, her eyes wide and tearless. \n\n Her name was Camila. \n\nAnd though she said nothing, her banner spoke:"

 nf_event_hea.622.desc:0 "Gente del Sol did not fall in silence. \n\n The Generalissimo’s palace rose like a mirage above the scorched streets — all white stone, golden railings, and velvet banners fluttering from each balcony. Even as the armies of Heaven’s Gate breached the outer defenses, the music did not stop. An orchestra played from the balcony of the Ministry of Culture. Gunsmoke danced with rose petals. Every soldier was dressed for a parade. \n\nVialla made his final speech to a full crowd. Not of citizens, but of mirrors. He looked them in the eye as the ground shook beneath him. And when the power finally failed, his voice did not. \n\n “Let them come,” he said. “We will greet them in gold.” \n\n The last stand of Gente del Sol was fought not in trenches, but along marbled promenades and casino stairwells. The arsenals were opened. Men and women who once danced in ballrooms now held rifles crusted with rubies. Their uniforms were spotless. Their bullets found flesh. \n\n But Heaven's Gate did not come to dance. They came to end a pageantry that had cloaked blood with glitter, raiding with ceremony. They tore through the streets like a hymn, burning silks and sanctifying bones. Faith outlasted fashion. \n\n At the steps of the Grand Villa, Vialla’s final defenders fell in lines — not because they had to, but because he had arranged it that way. Artillery shattered the mosaic of his own face on the garden floor. \n\n His body was never found. Some say he died with a smile. Others say he vanished into the crowd, disguised in a soldier’s coat, humming the national anthem as his world ended. \n\n A child named Esperanza — once an urchin who lived in the villa’s shadow, now barefoot and bruised — emerged from the ruins holding a flag. Its fabric was untouched. Its weight was unbearable. \n\n One by one, the handprints were pressed into it. Burnt fingers. Powder-scorched palms. The marks of the faithful and the damned, all the same in ash. \n\n When Esperanza’s Flag was raised above the burned-out radio tower, the wind did not blow. \n\n It simply waited. \nLike the dead. \nLike the General. \n Like history. \n\n Esperanza’s Flag remembers. And it sings of endings dressed in gold."

 nf_event_hea.623.desc:0 "They came not as an army, but as a process. \n\n Ejércitos México did not charge. They unfolded. \n\n A million servo-limbs clattered against the earth, moving in syncopated rhythm with hearts that no longer beat. Their bodies were plate and piston, reanimated relics of dead wars — steel cadavers given motion by cold logic and ancient wrath. Some bore banners of the old world, half-melted insignias of a republic long dead. Others still wore uniforms, fused into chassis, bone turned to wire. Not soldiers. Not machines. Something in between. \n\n They poured from bunkers and freight yards, out of sunken silos and cavernous manufactories, in numbers beyond counting — an avalanche of ordinance and artificial will. They did not shout. They did not chant. Their gospel was the grinding of gears and the buzz of static. They did not come to conquer. They came to overwrite. \n\n Heaven’s Gate met them in the marshes — knights ablaze with scripture, their steam-valves hissing like war drums. They sang hymns older than any machine code. Their blades were wreathed in light, their banners soaked in prayer oil. \n\n But the machines did not stop. \n\n Even when cut in half, they crawled. When their heads were crushed, they walked headless. When they were driven into the bogs, they emerged still — dripping with algae, but untouched in will. They did not bleed. They did not break. The earth itself groaned beneath their weight. \n\n So Saint Michael brought the storm. \n\n From the sky fell angels of iron — the Twelvefold Flame, ancient weapons sealed beneath Mount Calvary, born anew in fire. War-saints dove from airships with psalm-bombs strapped to their chests. The fog lit with blessed detonations, circuitry screamed as holy pulses disrupted neural nets. Choirs of techno-clerics intoned binary scripture, hex-prayers that unraveled processor logic with every verse. \n\n For three days and three nights, the swamps burned. Not with heat — but with judgment. \n\n And when the final wave crashed — when the endless tide faltered, just for a moment — Saint Michael pressed forward, deep into the mire. \n\nThere, in a forgotten cathedral built from sunken silos and shattered screens, Michael found him. \n\n Santa Anna. \n\n Not standing. Not roaring. A face in a computer, roaring demands, roaring obedience. A facsimile of a poor excuse for a leader four centuries ago.  \n\n “You are man, no longer,” Michael said. “And this world needs no more ghosts.” \n\n His blade did not fall in anger. It fell in silence. \n\n With one stroke, the terminal shattered — and with it, the command link. All at once, the machines froze. \n\n Across the battlefield, steel limbs halted mid-step. Red optics faded. Weapons lowered. Then, slowly, the husks toppled — a mechanical forest of the dead, crashing into the muck with the sound of a world finally allowed to stop. \n\nAnd in the silence that followed, the static sang only one thing: “Awaiting orders...” \n\nBut none would come. \n\nSaint Michael stood amidst the shattered towers, watching the machines withdraw into fog. \n\n And there, beneath the shadow of a ruined statue, a child waited. Her name was Maria. The only survivor of a village erased in the first push. With trembling hands, she raised a new banner, stitched from the robes of priests and the bedsheets of the forgotten. \n\n She pressed into it the marks of the faithful, those few who had stood when even hope had fled. \n\nAnd as the mist parted, she whispered not a prayer, but a promise: “I won’t remember the machines. But I’ll remember who stopped them.”"

The Red Clergy had long since ceased to guide the people; they ruled instead, a tangled knot of bureaucrats and priests, each shouting doctrine while the flock starved.\n\n When Heaven’s Gate crossed the border, the Ministry did not meet them with armies — but with processions. Ragged monks with rusted rifles, banners woven from the robes of forgotten martyrs, choirs singing verses from both Gospel and Manifesto. The knights of the Gate watched in silence as the first of them knelt — not to parley, but to pray for strength that would not come. \n\n The battle was not swift. The Red Guard, fueled by decades of doctrine and despair, fought as zealots do — with blades stolen from history and rifles scavenged from graves. For every step the Gate advanced, a hymn was sung, a prayer was shouted, a brother or sister fell proclaiming the unity of Christ and Lenin. \n\n But faith alone could not stop the tide. \n\n In the shattered halls of Loidsminster Cathedral — the birthplace of the Ministry itself — the final stand was made. Candles burned atop altars. Holy books were piled into barricades. Children who had never seen a harvest clutched rifles older than the war itself. \n\n Saint Michael strode through it all like judgment incarnate. His sword stayed low until the last defender fell, their blood staining the cracked mosaic of a man with a cross in one hand and a hammer in the other. \n\n And in that broken place, a child waited. She had no hymnal. No rifle. Only a scrap of cloth — a piece torn from the cathedral's own altar cloth, stitched with trembling hands into a crude sun. \n\n The knights found her walking barefoot through the ruins, pressing the soot-stained hands of the fallen into her banner — priests and soldiers alike, friend and foe, marked with the same black ash. She did not weep. She did not speak. She simply carried their memory. \n\n When Saint Michael beheld her work — that patchwork flag, heavy with grief and defiance — he knelt. He pressed his own gauntleted hand into it, marking the cloth with soot and steam. Then he rose, and said: "Let it bear the weight of what was dreamed. And let it bear the hope that will yet come." \n\n The child raised her flag atop the broken bell tower, the ruined cross at her back, the smoke curling around her like incense. It did not wave in triumph. It did not shout of conquest. \n\n It whispered of a dream that was betrayed..."

The people who remained lived in the ruins like ghosts — trading stories instead of bullets, forgetting the world that came before. Some worshiped machines. Some worshiped nothing. Most simply endured. \n\n When the Knights of Heaven’s Gate entered the shattered city, they expected warlords, raiders, or perhaps a desperate militia. What they found instead were the Husks. \n\n They came on the second day — without sound, without fear. Emaciated, stumbling figures in shattered Brotherhood power armor, their eyes dim and lifeless. They bore no banner, only ancient sigils of an order long gone. And yet they fought with terrible precision — not for land, not for belief, but because they were told to. \n\n The battle for Seattle became a crawl through hell. \n\n Knights were dragged into the dark by whispering voices. Machine-ridden corpses pulsed with static-laced hymns. Every terminal they accessed showed the same message: “Faithless. Return to Circuit. Return to Source.” \n\n It was not just a city that forgot God. It was a city that remembered something else. \n\n By the fifth day, the Cathedral District was overrun. Steam hissed through broken vault doors as the Inquisition purged the vault-temples where the last pockets of the AI's flock had gathered. A cleansing — not just of heresy, but of memory. \n\n Saint Michael stood in the old city square beneath the corpse of a data tree, its trunk made of bundled wires and flickering lights. He gave no speech. He only knelt, and whispered: 'Your god never lived. Ours does. And He weeps for what you became.' \n\n Atop the skeletal remains of the Space Needle, where broadcast towers once roared with forgotten commands, a child stood alone. Her name was Noa, a mute girl rescued from the wreckage of a sunken chapel, her tongue burned long ago by chemicals. She had carried the flag all the way from Salt Lake without ever saying a word. \n\n No one asked her to raise it. She simply did. \n\n The banner fluttered — heavy with the soot-pressed handprints of the dead. And in that moment, something deep beneath the city let out one last signal. A pulse, unheard by human ears, that echoed toward the east. \n\n Below, the knights fell to one knee, singing no song of victory. \nOnly a psalm for those who forgot who they were. \nNoa’s Banner rose into the storm above, defiant and grieving"
